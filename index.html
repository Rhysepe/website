                <h1>Hi, I'm Reese Cajipe</h1>
                <h2>From 11-Orange</h2>
                <p>My full name's Reese Daniel T. Cajipe and I'm currently a student of 
                    Leyte National High School which 
                    is situated here in Tacloban City and I'm a grade 11 student in the Orange section. Please Scroll on the text.

                <p>Over the past few years, I've been questioning what I should pursue 
                    in life. I've dabbled in programming, mathematics, the piano, but it was
                    only recently that I could decide what It is that I should do.

                    Going back to 2022, I was struggling to be consistent in school. I tried to be one of those students that 
                    was smart and was at the top 
                    of the class. Sadly it didn't work out that way.

                    There were other big reasons why I couldn't do it but the main reason
                    why was the lack of motivation to do anything. Having nothing to 
                    motivate you in your life can make things harder to do. It doesn't
                    have to be something like a relationship; no, something simple like
                    aiming for top 1 in class to make my parents proud.

            <div class="slides">
                <p>A goal basically, but to me those type of goals don't 
                    really work out for me too well.
                    It's mostly because I ask too much.What's the point on getting high grades if you can get a great job
                    for less? Why exactly do we even aim high? Well the answer to that
                    is mostly because we are passionate about what we do, I however am not. Finding something I'm passionate 
                    about has been my goal ever since the pandemic ended.

                    I first tried out programming. Seeing how it was something practical, I thought why not try? 
                    After a few days, weeks, and monnths of trying however, it never really clicked. I had fun learning how 
                    to code, mostly games, but I never really did just for the sake of doing it. I was doing it because it's 
                    where the money's gonna be in the future.

            <div class="slides">
                <p>I then tried going in to mathematics after a classmate of mine who was really good at calculus. 
                    He inspired me to start learning some of the basics and it was quite hard at first but still, intruiging.
                    After a few days however, I soon realized that I never really tried learing the subject. I was only ever interested in it
                    when my friend talked about it. So I stopped, I stopped looking for something I was passionate about altogether.

            <div class="slides">
                <p>It is now currently summer break and I decided to find an anime to watch because I didn't really have 
                    anything to do at the time, and there it was, an anime about guitars. The anime followed a socially
                    awkward girl who learned the guitar and became an expert at it thinking it would get her friends, it 
                    didn't really work for 
                    some time however. But seeing how well she played the guitar and how she learned it from scratch just 
                    for the sake of a very 
                    simplistic goal of making friends, it inspired me. After I finished watching the anime, I asked my dad 
                    if I could borrow his 
                    guitar and to my surprise, he told me that I could have it.

            </div>
            <div class="slides">
                <p>I began learning the basics of the guitar, not out of scratch since I had some prior knowledge but still, 
                    I wanted to learn how expert guitarists are able to conjure up melodies out of thin air. Learning how the 
                    guitar worked and the basics of music theory was facinating, so I continued to learn. 

                    Fast forward to today, I'm still quite a newbie since It hasn't really been that long since I picked up the guitar. I'm 
                    currently wondering if this is just another one of those phases and I'll eventually lose interest but it's still quite early 
                    to say that. I'll just have to see.
